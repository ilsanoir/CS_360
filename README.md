While not fully functional, the goal of the app was to make a weight tracking application that a user would use to log their daily weights in order to make progress toward whatever desired weight the user detailed in the app. The landing screen required the user to login 
to an account which was stored in a database. After logging into their account, the user could view and edit their self-populated database of their daily weights. The execution of these designs weren't perfect, but the idea was definitely there.

Most of my coding went into modularity. Having unique methods to solve specific problems. Working with methods in this way makes code reusable and allows for easier iteration and alterations to be made. I avoided hardcoding values to ensure consitency across methods and to 
further encourage iteration.
I tested my code by running the developed app on an emulated android device. It revealed flaws with the code such as input validation and a lack in transition between screens. Testing code is just as important as the actually written code. Testing code reveals flaws, 
weaknesses and vulnerabilities that would otherwise be unaddressed.

Innovation for me came in the form of consideration. Prioritizing what I needed to do in order to accomplish the major goals of the app, rather than getting sidetracked and investing my time in other areas that could be tackled later on. By far my biggest challenge was 
getting Android Studio to work for me to begin with. The issue had to do with emulated android devices. Attempting to run one would crash my system and corrupt my gradle. Upon completely removing all traces of Android Studio from my system and then trying to run another 
emulated device, I could then get Android Studio to work.

I think my method design and implementation was the standout of my work. Designing somewhat simple SQLite methods and then implementing them to create, read, update and delete user information was quite interesting.
